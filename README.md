#Setup Script
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joedaniels29/setup_script.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joedaniels29/setup_script)


## Usage

This is a set of scripts that I use to set a computer up for development. My goal is a
setup script that can bootstrap itsself up from a single  `curl <url> | sh` and
entirely set itsself, and then the computer up.

This is a heavily customized fork of [ThoughtBot's ](https://thoughtbot.com)  [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)  script.
This script, however is much more opinionated and intends to install substantially more than thoughtbot.

##Tested âœ…

The beauty of this script is that despite the fact that we rarely setup new laptops,
CI servers can help us reason about how successful this script will be year over year.
Therefore, this script is intended to be well tested. (WIP.)
Travis-ci is testing this script make sure that everything installs.

## Contributing

For now, the script is hardwired to put all my configs and personal env. in place. you probs. dont want that for yourself. (Maybe you do?)

But if you want to help out, travis still needs some configuring to confirm that each thing builds.

##Install
Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joedaniels29/setup_script/master/bootstrap.sh
less bootstrap.sh
sh bootstrap.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

## Debugging
#### FUTURE! (WIP.)

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
